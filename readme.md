# [EN-US] Minesweeper game

This project showcases a clean implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using the following techs:
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6);
- HTML5 (Semantic);
- CSS3 with attr selectors and state styling.

---

## Features

- Usage of `[data-*]`  selector, very useful for both CSS styling and JavaScript logic;
- `:not.()` CSS usage for exceptions;
- Advanced selectors like `[attr-^]` (starts with...) and `[attr$]` (ends with...) targeting theme flexibilization;
- Script organization following good practices.

---

## Principes

- Single Responsibility (SRP);
- Separation of Concerns (SoC);
- DOM manipulation.

---

## Objetive

Implementation of logic and styling efficiency/cohesion for a front-end focused application, using a classic game to show deep understanding of context rules, exceptions, game(difficulty) design and user experience.

---

## How to run

Just open `index.html` in any browser.

---

## Future updates

1. Scoring system (Game design);
2. `localStorage` to data persistance such as game state;
3. Touch support (Mobile);
4. Keyboard navigation (Acessibility).
